# Sanity Inventory Sync App

This is a server application for synchronization of Shopify inventory items (product variants) in locations (warehouses) and Sanity Dataset.

## Initial script

There is an initial script in `script` folder. This script runs once before app starts, to initialize inventory locations and update product variants with quantities by related locations.
